# Caesar Cipher

This Console app was produced using *.NET 5*, by following the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) practice exercises.

It is my take on the popular **Caesar Cipher** exercise.

Upon startup, the user is prompted to input a string. Afterwards, the user provides the key by which the string's characters are shifted forward.
Numbers, spaces and special characters are *not* influenced. Upon reaching the end of the alphabet, the cipher loops to the beggining of the alphabet.
